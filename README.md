## Project Overview

In my database class, we were tasked with building a project using SQL. While most of my classmates created a basic store, I saw an opportunity to challenge myself and take things further. After consulting with my professor, I decided to **build and host my own personal portfolio website from the ground up!**

This wasn‚Äôt just a quick project‚Äîit took **countless hours of designing, coding, debugging, and deploying**. I developed both the **frontend and backend from scratch**, using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL**. My portfolio dynamically stores my **technical skills, work history, and projects in a SQL database**, managed through **phpMyAdmin and Apache**. From handling database queries to ensuring seamless UI/UX, this project pushed my problem-solving skills to the next level.

One of the biggest challenges was integrating everything smoothly‚Äîsetting up the database, writing efficient queries, and making sure my portfolio was **secure, scalable, and fully functional**. Despite the hurdles, seeing it live on my own domain made all the hard work worth it.

This experience reinforced my passion for **full-stack development**, database management, and deploying real-world applications. Excited to keep improving and adding new features!
